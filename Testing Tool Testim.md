*\*Part 1. Automated testing tool\**

![](https://github.com/Swati110584/Testing-Tool-Assignment-Images/blob/master/Logo.PNG?raw=true)

Q1.1 Describe your automated testing tool based on the rubric and detailed  
questions developed by the class. This should describe the type of testing tool  
it is, what is its main characteristics, how it is being developed and  
maintained, which type of models and information is based on etc. Write down  
your answers that describe (as well as links) to the tool. 

Ans:- **\*\*Testim (\*\***\<https://www.testim.io/\>**\*\*)\*\*** is detailed as "\*Artificial  
intelligence based test automation\*". It uses artificial intelligence to  
speed-up the authoring, execution, and maintenance of automated tests.

**\*\*Testim\*\*** is the fastest way to resilient end-to-end tests, in code, codeless,  
or both.

**\*\*Testim.io\*\*** is a test automation tool that doesn’t require coding. Anyone can  
create tests, save them, and execute them again at any time. Re-use tests as  
regression as you progress through the agile workflow.

Testim.io is a tool which can also be considered as a platform that includes  
almost all the prime factors like Authoring & Execution, maintenance,  
troubleshoot, reporting, etc., of automated tests. Considering the concept of  
Dynamic locators, it focusses on testing types like functional testing,  
end-to-end testing, and UI testing.

It increases the protractile and constancy of test suites. And also gives the  
teams and the organizations, the resilience to develop the functionalities of  
the platform using complex programming logic with JavaScript and HTML.

**\*\*Testim\*\*** is **\*\*"Browser Testing"\*\***.

[Testim.io](http://testim.io/) alleviates the automation scripts depending on  
the changes that the applications go through. This effectively removes the  
flakiness of the automation suites.

**\*\*Testim\*\*** is a modern day automated testing tool. It uses machine learning to  
speed the authoring, execution, and maintenance of automated tests. The tester  
can scrutinize any test case in few minutes and execute them on multiple web and  
mobile platforms.

**\*\*Key Features of Testim:\*\***

● Easily add annotations to find out what's wrong in the system.    
● Developers just need to click the automated bug test to reproduce in the  
browser automatically.    
● Quickly view and share easy-to-understand annotated screenshots using the bug  
tracker.    
● It uses machine learning to speed the authoring, execution, and maintenance of  
automated tests.

● It can be easily integrated with different CI/CD tools.

**\*\*Testim\*\*** uses Dynamic Locators, The Artificial Intelligence (AI) underneath  
the platform in real time which analyzes all the DOM objects of a page and  
extracts the objects and its properties. Here, the AI decides the best location  
strategy to locate a particular element based on this analysis. Due to this,  
even if a developer changes the attribute of an element, the test still  
continues to run and this leads to more stable tests. As a result, the authoring  
and execution of automated tests are much faster and more stable.

Testim is an end-to-end agile testing automation solution which utilizes machine  
learning for test authoring, execution, and maintenance. Users can create tests  
in minutes, run thousands of tests in parallel across different browsers,  
integrate with their existing CI/CD and collaboration tools, and more.

With Testim, users can create tests either by recording or by code, or utilize  
both in any combination. Test steps can be reused for any other tests users may  
be running. Thousands of parameters are analyzed for each element, with Testim  
weighing their overall reliability before ranking them accordingly. Tests can be  
run with different data sets and conditions, and full customization capabilities  
are offered, allowing users to run tests on different browsers, operating  
systems, starting URLs, and more. Visual validations, through native integration  
with Aplitools Eyes allow users to check pixels, fonts, and other visuals  
through a screenshot.

Testim enables the running of thousands of tests in parallel across multiple  
browsers to provide results in minutes. Tests can be run on-premise, on users’  
private clouds, or on the Testim cloud. Through integration with CI/CD systems,  
apps can be deployed automatically when all tests are passed, and feedback on  
issues can be relayed quickly to developers. All information for failed tests is  
accessible, and bugs can be reported to bug trackers with a single click. Video  
and screenshots of bugs can be captured, and users can add annotations to  
highlight what is wrong. Automated tests can also reproduce the bug locally in  
the browser for developers to view.

**\*\*How is this tool different from other tools?\*\***

**\*\*The use of static ID’s.\*\***

**\*\*For Example,\*\*** a developer changes the ID name or some attribute of an element  
on the web page. The automated tests immediately break due to this change, as it  
is still referring to the old ID name. This leads to unstable tests and the  
testers have to spend a lot of time in maintaining them.

The introduction of the concept of **\*\*Dynamic locators\*\*** resolves it.*\* \**The  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) underneath the platform in real time, analyzes all  
the DOM objects of a page and extracts the objects and its properties.

Finally, the AI decides the best location strategy to locate a particular  
element based on this analysis.

Due to this, even if a developer changes the attribute of an element, the test  
still continues to run and this leads to more stable tests. *\*\**As a result of  
this, authoring and execution of automated tests are much faster and more  
stable.*\*\**

\#\#\# \*Create tests your way\*

There are two ways to create tests in Testim — record them using the Testim  
Extension or code them in your IDE. Actually, there’s a third and recommended  
approach for those who want to code—record the test, export it as code and  
modify it in your IDE.

When you record a test, each UI action leverages our AI-based platform to  
analyze the DOM, weigh the attributes associated with an element and create  
Smart Locators that uniquely identify elements. If attributes such as the color,  
class, text or location of an element are changed by development, our AI will  
still be able to uniquely identify the element so that your test doesn’t fail.

Testim has many features built into the visual test editor to help you customize  
your tests such as validation of text, email, PDFs, or conditions and loops. You  
can also insert JavaScript into any step so that you can handle nearly  
any UI situation.

If you are into JavaScript, you can also export your test as code and customize,  
debug, or refactor it your IDE; the choice is yours.

When your tests are ready, you can run on-demand or schedule a test run within  
Testim. We also make it really easy to run your test following a CI action.  
Tests can be parallelized and across all browsers on our test cloud or any  
Selenium-compatible test cloud.

Regardless of how your tests were created (code or codeless) when they run, you  
will see the results in Testim so you can troubleshoot. If you find an  
application defect, our bug capture tool makes it really easy to create a bug  
report, complete with screenshots, video and the test steps to recreate it. Pop  
it into Jira or Trello to submit your report in minutes. Our reporting shows  
test run history, including managerial reports so you can show all of the great  
work you’ve been doing and that releases are ready to ship.

Q1.2 Give an example usage of your testing tool. You may give an example code,  
commands, or screenshots (if your tool is more graphical) to exemplify its use.  
You should also describe how the tool can be used and what kinds of situation or  
cases the tool can be applied?

Ans:-

Once we click on “Create test” it will ask to install the Testim extension for  
the Chrome browser:

 

 

![](https://github.com/Swati110584/Testing-Tool-Assignment-Images/blob/master/14.PNG?raw=true)

\#\#\# Test :-

Type “Calculator” on Chrome. Below window will be seen:-

![](https://github.com/Swati110584/Testing-Tool-Assignment-Images/blob/master/15.PNG?raw=true)

Let’s build a test for “+” button. To do that, click on the Testim extension’s  
icon, as you can see in the following image:

![](https://github.com/Swati110584/Testing-Tool-Assignment-Images/blob/master/16.PNG?raw=true)

That will open the following menu:

![](https://github.com/Swati110584/Testing-Tool-Assignment-Images/blob/master/17.PNG?raw=true)

Check “CREATE AUTOMATED TEST.” Doing so will open Testim and attach the current  
tab to it. Then, go back to the calculator tab. There, you’ll see this:

![](https://github.com/Swati110584/Testing-Tool-Assignment-Images/blob/master/18.PNG?raw=true)

Try application, and Testim will record your activities. We’ll create a test  
that verifies the “2 + 2” sum works as intended. Just perform the operation  
normally and, as soon as you’re done, go back to Testim, which should look like  
this:

![](https://github.com/Swati110584/Testing-Tool-Assignment-Images/blob/master/19.PNG?raw=true)

Click on “SAVE” and, when asked, enter a name and description for your test:

![](https://github.com/Swati110584/Testing-Tool-Assignment-Images/blob/master/20.PNG?raw=true)

Let’s run your recently created test. Click on the “Automate” button, located on  
Testim’s left panel:

![](https://github.com/Swati110584/Testing-Tool-Assignment-Images/blob/master/21.PNG?raw=true)

You’ll see a test list containing only your newly created test:

![](https://github.com/Swati110584/Testing-Tool-Assignment-Images/blob/master/22.PNG?raw=true)

Select the test, click on its “play” button, and it will run.

![](https://github.com/Swati110584/Testing-Tool-Assignment-Images/blob/master/23.PNG?raw=true)

After clicking on the button, you’ll be warned not to touch the mouse and  
keyboard while the tests run:

![](https://github.com/Swati110584/Testing-Tool-Assignment-Images/blob/master/24.PNG?raw=true)

Click on “OK.” The test will be run in a new Chrome tab, executing exactly what  
you’ve recorded. After the test finishes, the window will be closed. If you go  
back to the Testim tab, you should see the test’s result:

![](https://github.com/Swati110584/Testing-Tool-Assignment-Images/blob/master/25.PNG?raw=true)

Bad news: it didn’t really test anything. Let’s see why and how to fix it.

\#\#\# Adding a Verification

The test you’ve just created lacks a verification. In other words, the test must  
verify whether two plus two is really four. Without that, it doesn’t test  
anything.

Click on the “Automate” button again, which will take you back to the test  
listing. Click on the test name so you can edit it:

![](https://github.com/Swati110584/Testing-Tool-Assignment-Images/blob/master/26.PNG?raw=true)

Our test has six steps. We’re now adding an additional step—the validation.  
Click on the button with the “plus” sign, located just after the last step. This  
is what you’re going to see:

![](https://github.com/Swati110584/Testing-Tool-Assignment-Images/blob/master/27.jpg?raw=true)



Click on the “Validations” option (the one with the check sign), and you’ll see  
![](https://github.com/Swati110584/Testing-Tool-Assignment-Images/blob/master/28.png?raw=true)

Then, click on “Validate element text.” You’ll be taken back to the calculator,  
where you should click on the result field:

![](https://github.com/Swati110584/Testing-Tool-Assignment-Images/blob/master/29.PNG?raw=true)

Going back to Testim, you’ll see that the test has an extra step now:

![](https://github.com/Swati110584/Testing-Tool-Assignment-Images/blob/master/30.PNG?raw=true)

Hover over the new step and click on the engine icon to show the properties:

![](https://github.com/Swati110584/Testing-Tool-Assignment-Images/blob/master/31.png?raw=true)

Now it’s just a matter of editing the “Expected value” field, setting it to ‘4’.  
After doing that, click on the “SAVE” button again. You’ll see a box prompting  
you for a message explaining your change. Type “Add validation step” and click  
on OK:

Now you to have set the “Expected value” field to 4 and then click on “SAVE”  
again. When you’re prompted for a message, enter the “Add validation step.”

![](https://github.com/Swati110584/Testing-Tool-Assignment-Images/blob/master/32.PNG?raw=true)

We’re done adding a validation phase to our test. If we run it again, it will  
still pass. But this time, it’s going to be doing something useful, thanks to  
the verification step we’ve just added to it.
